1)	I putted all the linked arrays in the same for loop thus when the data from putted I to increment itself in the loop until its lesser than wish list items for example if wish list items is equals to 2, and I entered same ‘i’ in all the arrays brackets like this [i], so If I want to write print linked arrays together so in first loop all of the 0 elements of arrays are printed then in second loop all of the 1 elements are printed. In the same we can input also using scanf statements.
2)	This is done as array has the first value of 0 so in order to address it, we will have to use the iterator which is initialized to zero, for example in this case I is initialized to 0 in line number 49.
3)	I will describe the array to a kid by giving him an example of stack of books, from up to down, I will tell the kid that these books have locations like the topmost is the first one then after the first on is the second on and they store date son in the same way there are arrays in computer who have locations and store data.
