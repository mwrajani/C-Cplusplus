//> I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

I learned many things during this workshop, for example I learned that the variables we declare in a class are private automatically until 
you write public above it to make it available everywhere. The connection between the variables in the class object and the client code is
 through the member functions of the class which are public, so as the member functions are a part of the object, the private variables are
 available for the functions of the object. There is something called struct which is totally opposite of class. Everything is public until
 you specify it is private by writing it above it. I used all the stuff specified above in this workshop. Except the struct thing, but I 
used it in many workshops before.
I only had difficulty in knowing if the transfer function was from the class object or not. Then my friend told me that a global function
 means not from class object.
