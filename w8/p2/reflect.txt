//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
In this workshop, I learned how to define virtual functions. In this case, we have virtual functions in the shape class named getSpecs and draw. I also learned to create the abstract base 
class. In this case, the abstract class was shape, which contains all the virtual functions described above. All of the functions described above were implemented in one abstract class 
called LblShape which only contains the implementation for getSpecs. The other two classes called rectangle, and line are concrete class as both contain the implementation of both virtual 
functions. 
I faced difficulty in some parts of this workshop, like when I created the virtual destructor for shape, I was getting an error for not implementing it. I thought that this might be also 
like the definition of other virtual functions, but then when I shared my error with my friends, they told me that I should implement it too as a virtual function in shape class. This 
solved my error.
