////I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
I learned many things in this workshop, for instance, I learned to make function templates, in this case, select and printCollection were function templates. I also learned how to use class 
templates. In this case, the collection was a class template. I learned that a template is very useful as if we use a template function, this can be used for many different classes as one, 
so we donâ€™t have to make different functions for different classes. This makes the work easier for us and less prone to errors, as the less we code, the less we do errors.
I had some difficulties in this workshop also like I did not know how to use the class template constructer in the middle of a function template function. I solved this problem for myself 
through course notes. This workshop was easier than others as we had to code very less and there was no dynamic memory involved so no memory leak errors were involved.
