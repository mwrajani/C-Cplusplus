This workshop taught me many important lessons, for instances after doing this workshop I know that we can not use relational operators on strings. We must use the functions from the string library
 to compare the strings with each other. I learned this lesson when I was at the very end of this workshop but was not able to end the program with an exclamation mark and one of my friends told me
 that I can not compare the entered value with the exclamation mark by using the equals to operator. She told me that I must use a strcmp function which tells us, if two strings are equals to each 
other or not. The other thing I learned was that almost all the functions in our string libraryâ€™s implementation files were provided to us in cstrtools file and I got to know what happens in those
 functions by looking at the code on cstrtools.cpp files.

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
